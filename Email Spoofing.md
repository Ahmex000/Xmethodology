  ðŸ”¹ **p=none** â†’ The policy is weak; spoofed emails will not be blocked.  
  ðŸ”¹ **p=quarantine** â†’ Spoofed emails will be moved to the spam folder but not rejected.  
  ðŸ”¹ **p=reject** â†’ Spoofed emails will be completely rejected, making it the most secure option.  
  
  âœ… If the domain uses **p=none**, there is a high chance of successful **email spoofing**.  
  âœ… If the domain uses **p=quarantine**, you can try bypassing the filter using **advanced phishing techniques**.
