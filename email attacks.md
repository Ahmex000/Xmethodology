   - A type of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals like executives or CEOs.

5. **Email Injection**:
   - Injecting malicious content or commands into email headers or body to exploit vulnerabilities in email processing systems.

6. **Password Reset Poisoning**:
   - Manipulating password reset mechanisms to send reset links to an attacker-controlled email address.

7. **Reply-To Spoofing**:
